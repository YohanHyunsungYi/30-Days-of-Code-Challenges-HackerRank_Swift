## Simple Array Sum

Given an array of  integers, can you find the sum of its elements?
Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the size of the array. 
The second line contains  space-separated integers representing the array's elements.

Output Format
Print the sum of the array's elements as a single integer.

Sample Input
```
6
1 2 3 4 10 11
```

Sample Output
```
31
```

Explanation
We print the sum of the array's elements, which is: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 10 + 11 = 31


### Solution

```
import Foundation

// number of elements
let n = Int(readLine()!)!

// read array and map the elements to integer
let arr = readLine()!.components(separatedBy: " ").map{ Int($0)! }

// find and print the sum of array
var result = 0
for i in 0...(n-1) {
    result += arr[i]
}
print(result)
```
